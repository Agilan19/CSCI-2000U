How I Produced my CSV File

1. Downloaded the Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map.xlsx file as instructed from
the link given on the assignment document.

2. Opened the .xlsx file on LibreOffice Calc for Linux

3. Deleted all entries for all the columns except columns A, E, F, and I.
I then completely deleted those empty columns entirely shifting the E, F, and 
I columns to be under columns B, C, and D respectively. 

4. Under File, I chose Save As... 

5. Chose the name of the file to be "Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map_abridged"
as instructed and on the bottom right corner, I clicked "All Formats" and 
selected "Text CSV (.csv)" instead and then I navigated to my Assignment-4 
directory by going through my home "agilan" then selecting
"csci-2000-personal" and then selecting "Assignments" and then finally
selecting "Assignment-4" and then clicking the "Save" button on the bottom
right corner. 

6. It then gave me a dialog box informing me not all features can be 
maintained in the format I chose and I left the default settings they had 
given such as to seperate each column by only a ",".

7. I then double checked by going to File Manager and navigated to my
Assignment-4 directory and then I right clicked
my Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map_abridged.csv file and chose Open With
Mousepad and the columns are all perfectly seperated by only a "," for
all the rows.
