loffice classlist.csv 
In the dialog box that appeared, I set "From row: " to 3.

# of students in the list.




# part (c)
# How would you sort the list by the second column (i.e., by

Adam Holte would be at the top of the list.
Yevette Hayward would be at the bottom of the list. 

I manually searched through the csv file after opening it using loffice.

The repeated first names are Diego. I manually searched using loffice to find
this match. 


# part (f) [BONUS]
# Construct a Unix pipeline that extracts the last three digits of
# the student number and the first character of the first name to make
# a four-character identifier for each student.
